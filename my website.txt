        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
             Currently I am a warehouse associate and cyber security student. I've been on this journey for more than a year now, 
             but my passion for computers has been with me for much longer. Last year, with the support of my employer, I participated 
             in a cyber security boot camp, which opened my eyes to many new concepts and sparked my appreciation for Linux OS. 
             After successfully completing the boot camp, I took the Security+ exam and passed, marking a significant milestone in my journey.
        <p>
            Currently, I'm focused on breaking into the field. I'm enrolled in TCM's PEH course to delve into network penetration testing. My 
            initial goal is to obtain the PNPT certification, and thereafter, I aim to pursue the OSCP certification. With my strong work ethic 
            and determination, I'm confident in my ability to succeed in this exciting field of cyber security. Feel free to reach out to me!
        <p>
        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            As of right now I will be taking TCM's PJPT, following that I will take the PNPT exam. After the PNPT I will be preparing to pursue
            the OSCP certification.
        <p>
            Peace!
